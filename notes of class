make the best use of linear model to dieal with nonlinear model
  1. transformation, eg: ln(x)
  2. spline,  linear model with every window.
  
how to choose model?
  tradeoff between prediction accurary and model interpretability.
  subset selection/lasso,least square,GAM/tree, bagging/boosting, SVM/deep learning
  
  
today's class

tree-based methods

two part
1. simple decisoon tree, weakness: high variance, low accuracy
2. assemble trees, lose the understanding of tree structure
