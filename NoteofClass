make the best use of linear model to dieal with nonlinear model
  1. transformation, eg: ln(x)
  2. spline,  linear model with every window.
  
how to choose model?
  tradeoff between prediction accurary and model interpretability.
  subset selection/lasso,least square,GAM/tree, bagging/boosting, SVM/deep learning
  
  
today's class

tree-based methods

two part
1. simple decisoon tree, weakness: high variance, low accuracy
2. ensemble trees, lose the understanding of tree structure

regression tree
classfication tree

two strength of tree methods
  improve accuracy
  give variable improtance meansure
  
  try to learn slowly, which can avoid overfitness and improve prediction accuracy.
